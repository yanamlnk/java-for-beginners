# Java For Beginners

I have created this repository for portfolio purposes. Some time ago I have finished JetBrains "[Java For Beginners](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/8)" track with [certificate of completion](https://hyperskill.org/certificates/29730fb2-a507-422c-be34-a943c02c96db.pdf). During this track I have created 2 projects: one is inside this track, another one is outside:

1. [Battleship](https://github.com/yanamlnk/java-for-beginners/tree/main/battleship)

<sub>[Link](https://hyperskill.org/projects/125?track=8) to the project page on JetBrains.</sub>

> Writing games is probably one of the most exciting tasks in programming. Develop your own version of the popular "Battleship Game" to play with your friends!

2. [Encryption-Decryption](https://github.com/yanamlnk/java-for-beginners/tree/main/encryption-decryption)

> Privacy is an important matter is the realm of the Internet. When sending a message, you want to be sure that no-one but the addressee with the key can read it. The entirety of the modern Web is encrypted - take https for example! Donâ€™t stay behind: hop on the encryption/decryption train and learn the essential basics while implementing this simple project.

## About this repository

I will post here the code that I have used to pass test cases of the JetBrains platform. However I do realize that this code can still be improved.

Each folder with project has README.md file, where I provide the following information:
1. **Project details**: how many stages the project had, task description, test cases.
2. **Code details**: how it takes input, how it produce output, what concepts (like design patterns) or topics (like Arrays, Files) have I used for this project
